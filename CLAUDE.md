# Flashy

Flashcard study app built with React + TypeScript + Vite.

## Development


## Commits

- Use conventional commit syntax (feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, refactor:, test:, etc.)
- Ensure tests pass before committing and fix anything if necessary. If any tests
  needed fixing, let me review the changes before proceeding with the commit.
- Commit messages don't need to mention tests being added. Only mention tests when a
  large amount of tests were added for previously uncovered code, or there was a
  major refactoring of test code.


## Architecture

- Cards have front/back faces with 3D flip animation
- Swipe right = knew the card, swipe left = didn't know
